                        <h1>How to Choose Your Image Editing Partner</h1>
                        <section class="section-sm post-single-body" style="text-align:justify; border: none;">
                            <p>In this day and age of commerce, all sorts of businesses require images. Surely most of
                                them want to ensure a credible website and web presence. Stores need to showcase
                                attractive photos of their products in action. Imagine walking into branded shoe store
                                with no pictures on display! And of course there are e-commerce entities - these
                                companies live off good quality images that help make consumer decisions on the other
                                end. Photography has to be top-notch and we emphasized on the need for post production
                                on images to bring out the best in them.</p>

                            <p>Now, who will be doing the image editing? It takes time to learn the skills and patience
                                to deal with hundreds of raw images. It is best to outsource image editing tasks to
                                professional agencies. You, the eCommerce owner will not have to master editing skills
                                and focus full-time on business development, promotions and exploring networks. The key
                                is to find the efficient and reliable image processing company so you can relax that
                                your pictures are in good hands. What you need is a “partner” who will work alongside
                                you and understand your requirements. Image editing of eCommerce products done by
                                experienced and expert professionals will portray quality, specifications and will earn
                                customer favors. Remember that looks impact purchase impulses and buyers depend on
                                product photos only if they look authentic and offer enough information.</p>


                            <p>As you hunt for image processing firms, these are the first questions you should ask:
                                <br>

                                <li>How long they are in the market?</li>
                                <li>Are there positive reviews available by past clients?</li>
                                <li>What kind of image processing do they do?</li>
                                <li>Do they have experience in work related to your industry? If so, are there sample
                                    photos available?</li>
                                <li>Are there free trial options offered by the company?</li>
                                <li>Whether the price will suit your budget? What are the deals for revisions - in case
                                    more corrections are needed?</li>
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                It will be useful for you to determine what kind of image processing your photos need.
                                If you’re not sure which types of photo-editing services you need to accomplish the
                                look you want, it’s a good idea to ask and share examples with potential candidates.
                                Not all image processing firms do everything - some handle white background services
                                while others offer a range of services as clipping path to vector conversion.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Some firms specialize in specific industries. Others can either focus on broad
                                e-commerce clients or more narrowed down (high end luxury watches for example). Think
                                of clothing and electronics - these two things have separate textures - so different
                                expertise is required to smoothen out the edges. The editor does not have to be
                                specific to your niche, but if they have demonstrated experience and samples in your
                                industry, then go for it! In a similar manner, consider the capacity of the company -
                                some are equipped to handle a given number of orders. Once you scale your business,
                                there will be need for an expanded range of images for brand promotion. It is best to
                                ask about the project capacity of their team.</p>

                            <p>
                                You want the best quality editing on your shots. To judge the quality of processing
                                done by the company, look for the sample work on their website or social media
                                channels. Ideally there should be before and after versions of the sample photos. The
                                sample page will also inform if the firm has credible experience in your particular
                                industry, such as dessert store for example. Great editing comes with optimal use of
                                latest technology. Hence it is crucial your partner in editing adapts to new tools in
                                the market. You might enquire about the softwares that the firm uses. Try their free
                                trial option for sample images to test their effectiveness as editors, before going
                                into a long term business agreement.</p>

                            <p>The partner has to understand the sharp deadlines you have - thereby quick turnaround
                                time is what the photo processing requires. If the firm runs with a big team, chances
                                are the turnaround time for your output will be faster. Also it is a key factor whether
                                there is customer support from the editors round the clock - to meet your necessary
                                corrections. Client support attitude represents the work ethics of the company - when
                                you see that the partner cares about your every question and suggestion, you have found
                                your company to work with for the long term. You can also try to good idea to ensure
                                any company you’re thinking of hiring has a safe means of downloading and uploading
                                images. You do want a company who is obliged to keep your images and critical
                                information secure. Do you need to break your bank to hire an image editing company?
                                Surely not! Shop around for prices and see which suits your editing budget. As for
                                payment methods, get that information cleared right away - who wants surprises later on
                                that delay financial transactions?</p>

                            <p>On a parallel note, let's look at some technical requirements:<br>
                                <b>Size and zoom of eCommerce product images:</b> Product photos need zoom feature, and
                                hence the image editing and retouching service provider should be equipped with the
                                knowledge of this aspect. Size specifications and especially the trademark signs can
                                and are verified using the zoom function.</p>

                            <p><b>Color and shadow:</b> The image editing service provider should be conscious of the
                                fact that if a particular product has 4 to 5 color selections, its best to include
                                every option though a roll or in the slide bar to allow consumers view the product from
                                various angles.
                            </p>

                            <p><b>Angled shots & background selection:</b> Photographers love to capture images with
                                various perspectives to it, hence allowing the same kind of opportunity to viewers on
                                an eCommerce website. It works the best with multi-sized product images so your editor
                                should be able to use best resources to optimise the functions for this.</p>

                            <p>But before you choose your partner be cautious on considering the above mentioned points
                                otherwise it may decrease instead of increase your productivity and revenue margin.</p>
